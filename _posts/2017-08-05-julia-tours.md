More than 30 new [Numerical Tours](/julia/) in [Julia](https://julialang.org/) has just been released. It consists in all the most important Numerical Tours, and covers all the topics, from Wavelet image denoising to 3D mesh parameterization. [Enjoy!](/julia/)

This conversion has been funded by the ERC project [SIGMA-Vision](http://gpeyre.github.io/sigma-vision/), and it has been performed by [Ayman Chaouki](https://github.com/Chaoukia) and [Quentin Moret](https://github.com/qmoret), congratulation for this nice work!
