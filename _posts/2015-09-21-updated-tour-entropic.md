I have updated the tour on [Entropic Regularization of Optimal Transport]({{ site.baseurl }}/matlab/optimaltransp_5_entropic/). It now present the algorihtms the way they should be presented, i.e. using the concept of diagonal scaling, that corresponds to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the case of transport, and that can be extended to the computation of barycenters.
