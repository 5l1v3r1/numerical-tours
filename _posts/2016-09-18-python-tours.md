More than 30 new [Numerical Tours](/python/) in Python has just been released. It consists in all the most important Numerical Tours, and covers all the topics, from Wavelet image denoising to 3D mesh parameterization. [Enjoy!](/python/)

This conversion has been funded by the ERC project [SIGMA-Vision](http://gpeyre.github.io/sigma-vision/), and it has been performed by [Pierre Stock](https://github.com/pierrestock), congratulation for this nice work!
