[This tour explores](sparsity_9_sparsespikes_cbp) the use of the C-BP algorithm of Simoncelli and co-workers to solve sparse spikes deconvolution problems. This corresponds to extending the discrete basis-pursuit operator by performing a Taylor expansion to locate more precisely the spikes with sub-pixelic accuracy.
