[This tour details]({{ site.baseurl }}/matlab/meshproc_7_geodesic_poisson) the [Geodesic in Heat method](dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2516977), which allows one to approximate geodesic distances by solving a Poisson equation. It relies on the powerful results that the level sets of the heat diffusion converge to those of the geodesic distance as the diffusion time tends to 0.
