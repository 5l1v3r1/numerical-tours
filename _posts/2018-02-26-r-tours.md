More than 35 new [Numerical Tours](/r/) in [R](https://www.r-project.org/) has just been released. It consists in all the most important Numerical Tours, and covers all the topics, from Wavelet image denoising to 3D mesh parameterization and machine learning. [Enjoy!](/r/)

This conversion has been funded by the ERC project [NORIA](http://www.gpeyre.com/noria/), and it has been performed by [Abdellah Lamrani Alaoui](https://github.com/Abdellam1994), [Alex Delalande](https://github.com/AlxDel) and [Quentin Moret](https://github.com/qmoret), congratulation for this nice work!
