The *Numerical Tours of Signal Processing*, by [Gabriel Peyr√©](contact/), gather Matlab (and so some extend Scilab) experiments to explore modern signal and image processing.  These tours are also progressively being ported to Python. The tours are complemented by slides of courses that concentrate on the theory of  signal and image processing.
