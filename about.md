The *Numerical Tours of Signal Processing*, by [Gabriel Peyré](contact/), gather Matlab (and so some extend Scilab) experiments to explore modern signal and image processing. 
These tours are also progressively being ported to Python.
The tours are complemented by slides of courses that concentrate on the theory of  signal and image processing.


How to use these tours?
-------------------

Each tour is a set of experiments that can be performed using 
either Matlab or Scilab. At the beginning of each tour, 
you are asked to download and install the required toolboxes  ...
(there exists three toolboxes: general/signal/graph), that contain many useful 
helper functions. Each tour alternates between code you can copy/paste in 
Matlab or Scilab, and exercises you need to solve on your own.


How to cite the Numerical Tours
-------------------

If you are using codes from these Numerical Tours for your own research, you should cite the Numerical Tours as:

> G. Peyré, *The Numerical Tours of Signal Processing - Advanced Computational Signal and Image Processing*
> IEEE Computing in Science and Engineering, vol. 13(4), pp. 94-97, 2011.


How to make your own tours?
-------------------

Each Numerical Tour is a HTML web page automatically generated using a Matlab script, that both executes the intructions of the tour, and generates the web page.

You can download the [Numerical Tour Publishing Toolbox](tours/toolbox_publishing.zip), and use the same tools to create your own Numerical Tours. This can be very useful to generate numerical exercises for your students, or to present your research in a more atracting way.
