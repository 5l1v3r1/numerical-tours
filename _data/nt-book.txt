The Numerical Tours of Signal Processing is intended to be the companion books of the popular web-site  www.numerical-tours.com

The book will feature a detailed and expanded version of the most popular tours, including a unique interplay between a concise description of the mathematical tools, and a detailed Matlab implementation of state of the art methods in the fields of data image processing.

The book is intended for a broad audience of undergraduate and graduate students in applied mathematics and electrical engineering. It should also be of interest for researchers working in the fields of signal/image processing, data processing and machine learning.

All the Matlab codes needed to reproduce the figures of the book will be distributed through the platform www.numerical-tours.com, therefore adhering to the reproducible research paradigm.
