> Gabriel Peyr√© [Advanced Signal, Image and Surface Processing](AdvancedSignalProcessing.pdf)

It should be used as a reference for the Matlab/Scilab numerical tours. This is a work in progress, so it contains many typos and errors.

This book details advanced signal, image and image processing methods.  The focus in on the use of sparsity and variational methods to solve difficult problems such as denoising, compression, super-resolution and compressive sensing. The theoritical exposition is kept as simple as possible and the emphasis is put on numerical schemes and practical experimentation using Matlab.
